## Code Formatting

_Please make sure that your code follows the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines._

_Before committing your changes to the repository, run `pre-commit run --all-files` or `pipenv run lint` this will highlight and fix some errors._

_For PyCharm users you can use the key combination `Ctrl + Alt + L` to format your code._

_For VsCode users, create a `.vscode` folder in your project root and create a `settings.json` file inside it. Place the following in the `settings.json` file:_

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "python.formatting.provider": "autopep8"
}
```

_You can also use `autopep8` directly from the command line using `autopep8 -i filename`._
_After fixing all the errors, push your changes and then open a PR._
