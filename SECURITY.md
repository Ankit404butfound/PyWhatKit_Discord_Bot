# Security Notice

This is the security notice for PyWhatKit Discord Bot Repository. The notice explains how vulnerabilities should be reported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've found a vulnerability, we would like to know so we can fix it before it is released publicly. **Do not open a GitHub issue for a found vulnerability.**

Send details to an admin of the discord server through a direct message, including:

- the part of the code where the vulnerability can be observed
- a brief description of the vulnerability
- optionally the type of vulnerability
- non-destructive exploitation details

We will do our best to reply as fast as possible.

## Scope

The following vulnerabilities **are not** in scope:

- volumetric vulnerabilities, for example overwhelming a service with a high volume of requests
- reports indicating that our services do not fully align with “best practice”

If you aren't sure, you can still reach out via a direct message.
